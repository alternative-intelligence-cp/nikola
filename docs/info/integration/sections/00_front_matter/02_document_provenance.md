## SYNTHESIS PRINCIPLES

### No Information Loss

Every technical detail, implementation specification, defect description, and remediation strategy from all source documents has been preserved and integrated into this specification.

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts or ambiguities arose between documents:
1. **0_Nikola_v0.0.4_Specs.txt** serves as SOURCE OF TRUTH
2. Later/higher-numbered documents override earlier ones
3. Remediation documents override implementation documents
4. All conflicts resolved in favor of production-ready, defect-free implementations

### Integration Methodology

- Chronological synthesis from core specs → implementation phases → audits → remediation
- Cross-referencing maintained between related sections
- All defects cataloged with remediation status
- Work packages integrated at appropriate architectural layers
