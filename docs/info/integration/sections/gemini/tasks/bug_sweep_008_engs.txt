# RESEARCH TASK: ENGS Computational Neurochemistry Complete Specification

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_008_engs
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The ENGS (dopamine/reward system) needs detailed mathematical specification:

1. Neurochemical formulas not fully defined
2. Reward calculation algorithms incomplete
3. Curiosity metric undefined
4. Boredom detection mechanism missing

This prevents implementing autonomous motivation and learning systems.

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete neurochemical formulas with biological basis
2. Reward, curiosity, and boredom calculation algorithms
3. Integration strategy with training systems

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Section 5.1 - Computational Neurochemistry (ENGS)
- **part_5_of_9.txt**: ENGS implementation details

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
