# RESEARCH TASK: Neuroplastic Transformer Architecture Specification

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_005_transformer
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The neuroplastic transformer for nonary waveforms needs detailed specification:

1. Attention mechanism for waveform data undefined
2. Neuroplasticity update rules not specified
3. Weight initialization strategy missing
4. Training loop incomplete

This blocks the reasoning engine implementation.


---

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete attention mechanism design for nonary encoded waveforms
2. Neuroplasticity and neurogenesis algorithms with mathematical basis
3. Training protocol with initialization, update rules, and convergence criteria

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
