# RESEARCH TASK: Wave to Text Decoding Algorithm

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_013_wave_text_decode
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Line 3586 in part_2 identifies missing functionality:

Text → Wave: O(1) via hash lookup (exists)
Wave → Text: O(V) via linear scan (MISSING!)

The reverse decoding from wave to text is completely missing.


---

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete wave-to-text decoding algorithm
2. Optimization to reduce from O(V) complexity
3. Error handling for ambiguous or invalid waveforms

---

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_2_of_9.txt**: Lines around 3586 - Wave/Text conversion

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
