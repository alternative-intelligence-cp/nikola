# RESEARCH TASK: System Bootstrap Initial Conditions

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_012_bootstrap
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Lines 8425 and 8683 in part_1 identify undefined initial conditions causing catastrophic failures:

1. Undefined initial conditions for wave fields
2. Bootstrap timing issues
3. Seeding must complete BEFORE first propagate() call

This causes undefined behavior on system startup.


---

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete bootstrap sequence specification
2. Initial condition algorithms for all wave fields
3. Timing and ordering guarantees for startup

---

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Lines around 8425, 8502, 8683 - Bootstrap issues

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
