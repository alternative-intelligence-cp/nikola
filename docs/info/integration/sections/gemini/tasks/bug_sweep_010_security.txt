# RESEARCH TASK: Security System Complete Implementation

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_010_security
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The security system needs comprehensive specification:

1. Threat detection algorithms undefined
2. Input validation strategies incomplete
3. Permission check mechanisms not specified
4. Audit logging format missing

This is critical for safe deployment.

## DELIVERABLES

1. Threat detection and prevention algorithms
2. Input validation framework with examples
3. Audit logging specification and permission model

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Section 5.5 - Security Systems
- **part_5_of_9.txt**: Security implementation details

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
