# RESEARCH TASK: Working Memory Architecture

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_015_working_memory
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Line 10353 in part_1 identifies:

"Working memory concept undefined"

This is fundamental to the cognitive architecture but lacks specification.


---

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete working memory architecture specification
2. Capacity and retention algorithms
3. Integration with short/mid/long term memory systems

---

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Lines around 10353 - Working memory
- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Section 3.4 - Memory and Data Systems

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
