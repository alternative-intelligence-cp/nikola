# RESEARCH TASK: Mamba-9D State Space Model Implementation

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_004_mamba_integration
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The Mamba-9D integration with the toroidal layers needs specification:

1. State space equations for 9D toroidal geometry
2. Layer implementation strategy undefined
3. Forward pass logic incomplete
4. Backward pass for training not specified

This prevents implementing the cognitive architecture's memory system.

## DELIVERABLES

1. State space model equations adapted for 9D toroidal geometry
2. Layer-wise implementation strategy with memory requirements
3. Forward and backward pass algorithms with computational complexity

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
