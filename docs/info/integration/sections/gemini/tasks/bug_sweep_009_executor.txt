# RESEARCH TASK: Executor Sandbox and Permission System

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_009_executor
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The executor system with KVM hypervisor needs implementation details:

1. Sandbox implementation strategy undefined
2. Permission model not specified
3. Task queue architecture incomplete
4. Result callback mechanism missing

This blocks the execution environment for tools and self-improvement.


---

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete sandbox implementation strategy with security guarantees
2. Permission model specification with examples
3. Task queue and callback architecture with error handling

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Section 4.4 - Executor and KVM Hypervisor
- **part_2_of_9.txt**: Executor implementation details

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
