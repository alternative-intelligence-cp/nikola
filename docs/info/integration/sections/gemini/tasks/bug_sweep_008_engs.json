  "problem_statement": "\nThe ENGS (dopamine/reward system) needs detailed mathematical specification:\n\n1. Neurochemical formulas not fully defined\n2. Reward calculation algorithms incomplete\n3. Curiosity metric undefined\n4. Boredom detection mechanism missing\n\nThis prevents implementing autonomous motivation and learning systems.\n",
