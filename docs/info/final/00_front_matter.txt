## SYNTHESIS PRINCIPLES

### No Information Loss

Every technical detail and implementation specification from all source documents has been preserved and integrated into this specification.

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts or ambiguities arose between documents:
1. **0_Nikola_v0.0.4_Specs.txt** serves as SOURCE OF TRUTH
2. Later/higher-numbered documents override earlier ones
3. Specialized implementation documents provide detailed specifications
4. All conflicts resolved with clear technical specifications

### Integration Methodology

- Chronological synthesis from core specs → implementation phases → specialized plans
- Cross-referencing maintained between related sections
- All subsystems fully specified at appropriate architectural layers
- Final publication edition eliminates all internal task tracking identifiers
