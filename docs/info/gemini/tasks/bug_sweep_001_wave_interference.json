  "problem_statement": "\nThe Wave Interference Processor is a core component but has several implementation gaps:\n\n1. Missing wave equation formulas for 9D toroidal space\n2. Incomplete interference calculation algorithms\n3. Undefined phase synchronization mechanisms\n4. Placeholder finite difference stencils for grid neighbors (line 2598-2599 in part_1)\n5. Missing mixed derivative calculations (line 4398 in part_1)\n\nThese gaps prevent actual implementation of the wave physics engine.\n",
