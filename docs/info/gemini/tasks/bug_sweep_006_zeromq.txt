# RESEARCH TASK: ZeroMQ Spine Complete Protocol Specification

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_006_zeromq
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The ZeroMQ spine architecture lacks implementation details:

1. Message protocol format undefined
2. Connection management strategy incomplete
3. Routing logic not fully specified
4. Error handling mechanisms missing

This prevents implementing inter-component communication.


---

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete message protocol specification with schema definitions
2. Connection management and routing algorithms with failure handling
3. Error recovery strategies and retry policies

---

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Section 4.1 - ZeroMQ Spine Architecture
- **part_2_of_9.txt**: ZeroMQ implementation details
- **part_9_of_9.txt**: Protocol specifications

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
