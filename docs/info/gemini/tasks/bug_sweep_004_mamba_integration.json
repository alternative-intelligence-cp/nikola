  "problem_statement": "\nThe Mamba-9D integration with the toroidal layers needs specification:\n\n1. State space equations for 9D toroidal geometry\n2. Layer implementation strategy undefined\n3. Forward pass logic incomplete\n4. Backward pass for training not specified\n\nThis prevents implementing the cognitive architecture's memory system.\n",
