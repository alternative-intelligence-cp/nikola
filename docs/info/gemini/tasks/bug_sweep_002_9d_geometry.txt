# RESEARCH TASK: 9D Toroidal Geometry Complete Mathematical Specification

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_002_9d_geometry
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The 9D toroidal geometry is mentioned throughout but lacks concrete implementation details:

1. Dimension mapping algorithms undefined
2. Toroidal coordinate transformations incomplete
3. Spatial transformation matrices missing
4. Dimension traversal logic not specified

Without these, the foundational geometry cannot be implemented.

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete mathematical specification of 9D toroidal coordinate system
2. Transformation matrices and algorithms for all 9 dimensions
3. Efficient traversal algorithms for toroidal space with complexity analysis

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Section 2.1 - 9-Dimensional Toroidal Geometry
- **part_2_of_9.txt**: Geometry implementation details

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
