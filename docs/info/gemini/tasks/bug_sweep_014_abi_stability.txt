# RESEARCH TASK: ABI Stability Implementation Guidelines

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_014_abi_stability
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Lines 1197-1238 in part_2 identify ABI stability issues:

1. Incomplete type issues with unique_ptr<Impl>
2. Mixed PIMPL/non-PIMPL causing partial instability
3. Missing forward declarations

This affects long-term maintainability and compatibility.


---

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete PIMPL implementation pattern for all classes
2. ABI stability verification checklist and tools
3. Migration guide for existing code

---

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_2_of_9.txt**: Lines around 1197-1238 - ABI stability

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
