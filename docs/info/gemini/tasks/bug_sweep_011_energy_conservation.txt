# RESEARCH TASK: Physics Oracle Energy Conservation Implementation

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_011_energy_conservation
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Line 5038 in part_1 identifies a critical bug with false-positive SCRAM resets:

The naive Physics Oracle detects missing energy as a violation of conservation 
laws (energy destruction) and triggers false-positive SCRAM resets, interrupting 
the AI's thought process.

This needs a proper energy accounting system.

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete energy conservation tracking algorithm
2. False-positive detection and filtering mechanism
3. SCRAM reset policy with appropriate thresholds

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Lines around 5038 - Physics Oracle issues

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
