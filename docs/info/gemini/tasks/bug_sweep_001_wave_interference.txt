**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** PENDING

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The Wave Interference Processor is a core component but has several implementation gaps:

1. Missing wave equation formulas for 9D toroidal space
2. Incomplete interference calculation algorithms
3. Undefined phase synchronization mechanisms
4. Placeholder finite difference stencils for grid neighbors (line 2598-2599 in part_1)
5. Missing mixed derivative calculations (line 4398 in part_1)

These gaps prevent actual implementation of the wave physics engine.

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete mathematical formulas for wave propagation in 9D toroidal geometry
2. Production-ready C++ algorithms for interference calculations with error bounds
3. Phase synchronization protocol with timing guarantees

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
