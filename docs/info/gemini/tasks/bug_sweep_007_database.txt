# RESEARCH TASK: Nonary Waveform Database Architecture

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_007_database
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


The high-performance database for nonary waveforms needs specification:

1. Schema definition for waveform storage
2. Query interface design incomplete
3. Embedding storage strategy undefined
4. Index structure for efficient retrieval missing

This blocks the memory and data systems implementation.

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete database schema for nonary waveform storage
2. Query interface API with examples and performance characteristics
3. Index structure design with complexity analysis

## RELEVANT PLAN SECTIONS

- **part_1_of_9.txt**: Section 3.4 - Memory and Data Systems
- **part_5_of_9.txt**: Database implementation details

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
