# RESEARCH TASK: Balanced Nonary Encoding Complete Algorithms

**Task ID:** bug_sweep_003_nonary_encoding
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** PENDING
**Created:** 2025-12-11 12:28

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Balanced nonary encoding is fundamental to the entire system but lacks implementation:

1. Encoding algorithm not fully specified
2. Decoding algorithm missing
3. Conversion functions between nonary and other formats undefined
4. Validation logic incomplete

This blocks data representation throughout the system.

## DELIVERABLES

1. Complete balanced nonary encoding/decoding algorithms with examples
2. Conversion functions to/from binary, decimal, and text with test cases
3. Validation and error correction algorithms

- **part_2_of_9.txt**: Nonary implementation details

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

Please provide detailed research and analysis for each deliverable listed above. 
Reference the relevant plan sections provided to ensure consistency with the 
overall architecture. If you find gaps or inconsistencies in the plan sections, 
please note them in your response.

**IMPORTANT - HOW TO FIND SECTIONS:** 
- Each compilation file has clear section markers like:
  ================================================================================
  SECTION X.Y: Component Name
  ================================================================================
- Use text search (Ctrl+F) for keywords instead of section numbers
- The files have internal numbering that differs from the TOC - IGNORE internal numbers
- Search for concepts like "Wave Interference", "Mamba", "ZeroMQ", etc.
- All relevant content is in the files listed above

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Focus on providing concrete, implementable solutions
- Include code snippets, formulas, or specifications where applicable
- Flag any assumptions you need to make
- If you can't find something, note what's missing rather than making assumptions
