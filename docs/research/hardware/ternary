I have created a comprehensive hardware accelerator design plan for the Nikola Model v0.0.4 that handles balanced nonary (base-9) and 9D wave interference operations.

**Key Specifications:**

**Memory Recommendation:**
- **Type:** HBM2e (FPGA) / HBM3 (ASIC)
- **Capacity:** 8 GB minimum recommended (supports 81³ grid + working memory), 16 GB for production
- **On-chip SRAM:** 32 MB for L1/L2 caching, LUTs, and hot node storage
- **Bandwidth:** 460 GB/s (HBM2e) / 820 GB/s (HBM3)

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Nonary Processing Unit (NPU):** Custom ALUs for balanced nonary arithmetic (-4 to +4) with saturation logic
- **9×9 Systolic Array:** Hardware acceleration for metric tensor operations (45 unique values per node)
- **DDS Engine:** 8-channel Direct Digital Synthesis with 64-bit phase accumulators and 16K sine LUT
- **Hilbert Curve Engine:** 256 coords/cycle for 9D Morton encoding/decoding
- **PCIe Gen 5.0 x16:** 64 GB/s host interface with zero-copy memory mapping

**Recommended Development Path:**
- Phase 1: Xilinx Versal VP1902 FPGA ($15K, 8 GB HBM2e)
- Phase 2: Custom ASIC tape-out (TSMC 5nm, 16 GB HBM3, 100 TOPS nonary)

The plan accounts for the TorusNode structure (256 bytes aligned) and the unique computational requirements of wave interference processing, neuroplastic metric tensor updates, and Mamba-9D state space model operations.
