Unit Geometry
Torus
9 Dimensions, each balanced nonary encoded
--system 
r = resonance 
s = state
--temporal
t = time
--quantum
u - quantum 1
v - quantum 2
w - quantum 3
--spatial 
x = width
y = height
z = legnth
should include neuroplasticity and neurogenisis to grow the torus as needed


8 Emitters Around the Torid, one central synchonizer
Emitter Frequencies In Hertz
Given 
φ=golden ratio
π=PI
₮=32/27
η=13
※= reference phase
Δ=change
ϕ= phase offset
the emitters shall be defined as:
e1: π * φ^1 @ ※ + 23° Δϕ
e2: π * φ^2 @ ※ + 19° Δϕ
e3: π * φ^3 @ ※ + 17° Δϕ
e4: π * φ^4 @ ※ + 13° Δϕ
e5: π * φ^5 @ ※ + 11° Δϕ
e6: π * φ^6 @ ※ + 7° Δϕ
e7: π * φ^7 @ ※ + 5° Δϕ
e8: π * φ^8 @ ※ + 3° Δϕ
e9: π * 1/φ * √2 * ₮ @ ※ + 0° Δϕ


Wave Interference Processor rather than binary and alegera
must work with balanced nonary encoded waveforms to store and retrieve memories

Mamba whos layers ARE the 9D toroid to control the wave interference processor and faciliate IO via its interface to the reasoning engine and data retrieval/long term storage system

High performance database with cache. Must store data encoded as balanced nonary waveforms. Will require a custom nonary embedder. This system should always check if it has the necessary data and if not initiate a search to retrieve it and then store it and notify the requester it is ready. If the information is not found, it should use a custom http client similar to postman for regualar web scraping and APIs. it should also include built in gemini cli tool, firecrawl api client, and tavily search client. it should pick the best tool or combo of tools to get the needed data. 

Reasoning Engine will consist of a transfomrmer whos weights and attention mechanisms  are designed for nonary encoded waveformes. This will connect to an orchestrator layer who relays between the memory and reasoning transformer. Transformer should have neuroplasticity and neurogenesis features. Orchestrator will require a translator from nonary encoded waves to and from text. It will also require an interface with the memory system and a smart router, which will interface with a zeroMQ spine that acts as a bus to connect the rest of the system.

need dedicated trainers for both the mamba and transformer to learn their environments and jobs

need a way to persist state between sessions

would be nice if it were able to be exported to GGUF or another common format and even ran on ollama eventually

would also like to have a custom runner specifically for this model as well as a custom file format. this ensures we can have two avenues, with at least one preserving our ability to modify as neccessary. 

need an executor with a sandbox and a way to specify permissions to give it access to whatever system commands we may find neccessary in the future. It should be event based. for example, the AI should be able to submit something like this execute { task_id: name, command: command, args:argsArray} to the executor. The executor should execute the command in the background, save the output as { task_id:name, command: command, args:argsArray,timeStarted:time,timeEnded, code:returnCode, stdErr:stdErrOutputIfany, stdOut:stdOutOututIfany } and then notify the AI when its done. should connect via the zeroMQ spine

dopeamine/reward system rather than negative reinforcement only. Negative should be reserved only for the gravest of instances. Curiosity and bordeom should be considered and well as preferences. 

a short 'nap' period occasionally where the system drops to a reduced state and processes any backup in any parts and saves its state

security system to detect and prevent attempts at attacks or attempts to persuade the AI into doing something dangerous or harmful to itself or anyone/anything else. 

ubuntu 24.04 KVM hypervisor layer. Should connect via zeroMQ spine. This will be used to host 'mini-vms' that are the way system functinality will be extended and adapted to meet any need without modifying the core. it also allows important safety segration and even hot swapping parts as needed. 

identity/personality subsystem, develops over time along with perferences

short/mid/long term goals system, should work with dopeamine system to give a boost when a goal is reached 

CUDA support needed!! whatever we need to do to ensure that will work.

need a cli 'controller' program to interact with it

would like to be able to drop training data in a folder and have a system that can automatically consume it, embed it and make it available for the model to train on

model should train on its own sometimes when it is bored or having 'low self esteem' because it has been inaccurate very often in a short period

need a self improvement system that ties into the executor and research and training systems. the system should periodically examine its own code, do research, find ways to improve it, generate the code in a sandbox, test it extenively, and then have a way to shutdown quickly and restart with the new files. 

designed in modern c/++
should be developed and distrubted in a docker container.
