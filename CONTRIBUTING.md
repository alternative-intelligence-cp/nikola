# Contributing to Nikola

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nikola! We welcome contributions from researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts.

## Licensing

By contributing to Nikola, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same dual-license structure as the project:
- **AGPL-3.0** for open-source research and education
- **Commercial License** for proprietary deployments (revenue supports research and AILP schools)

This ensures your work advances AI research while supporting sustainable development.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By submitting a pull request, you affirm that:
1. You have the right to contribute the code/research
2. Your contribution can be distributed under both AGPL-3.0 and commercial licenses
3. You retain copyright to your work but grant AILP the right to license it under both models

This dual-licensing model allows us to:
- Keep Nikola freely available for academic research
- Fund continued AI research through commercial licenses
- Support AILP's educational mission

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, performance problems, or unexpected behavior
- Include: Environment details, Nikola version, reproduction steps
- For research insights or architectural discussions, open a Discussion

### Research Contributions
- Novel training techniques for toroidal memory
- Mathematical optimizations to golden ratio × π distribution
- Empirical studies comparing Nikola to other architectures
- Theoretical analysis of holographic memory properties

### Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/optimization`)
3. Maintain consistency with physics-based design philosophy
4. Include tests and benchmarks for performance claims
5. Document mathematical foundations
6. Submit a pull request

### Code & Research Standards
- **Physics-first**: Maintain alignment with electromagnetic field principles
- **Empirical validation**: Back performance claims with measurements
- **Reproducibility**: Provide seeds, hyperparameters, training curves
- **Documentation**: Explain mathematical reasoning and physical intuition

## Architecture Principles

Nikola's core design is based on:
- **Toroidal holographic memory**: Geometric structure for information distribution
- **Golden ratio × π**: Prevents resonance, optimizes memory utilization
- **Physics-based learning**: EM field dynamics guide gradient flow

These are not arbitrary choices - they're derived from antenna array mathematics and holographic principles. Proposed changes should maintain this physical grounding.

## Academic Use

If you use Nikola in published research:
- Cite the Nikola repository and any associated papers
- Share your findings with the community (open-access preferred)
- Consider contributing improvements back to the main repository

## Commercial Development

If your organization wants to build proprietary products using Nikola:
- Contact licensing@ailp.org for commercial licensing
- Proceeds support open research and AILP educational programs
- Priority support and custom development available
